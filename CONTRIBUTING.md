# Contributing to BX-bot
BX-bot is released under the [MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) license. 
If you would like to contribute something, or simply want to hack the code, this document should 
help you get started.
 
## Reporting bugs and suggesting enhancements
If you find a bug, please submit an [issue](https://github.com/gazbert/crypto/issues). Try to 
provide enough information for someone else to reproduce it. Equally, submit an issue if you want 
to create a new feature or enhance an existing one - refactoring, improving Javadoc, and boosting 
test coverage is always welcome!

One of the project's maintainers should respond to your issue within 48 hours... if not, bump the 
issue and request that it be reviewed.

## Contributor workflow

Review the [issues list](https://github.com/gazbert/crypto/issues) and find something that 
interests you. It is wise to start with something relatively straightforward and achievable. 
Usually there will be a comment in the issue that indicates whether someone has already 
self-assigned it. If no one has already taken the issue, then add a comment assigning the issue to 
yourself, e.g. ```I'm working on this issue because I love writing Javadoc...``` 

Please be considerate and rescind the offer in a comment if you cannot finish in a reasonable time,
or add a new comment stating that you're still actively working on the issue and need a little 
more time.
